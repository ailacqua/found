5. An app where users can report lost items or post found items. Users can upload an item with location, description, image, and share their contact info. Using contact info, users can make sure that the item gets to the proper owner.
6. For the backend requirements we have 8 requests outlined in the API specification. Some of them are: a GET request for returning all the Cornell locations, a GET request for all Items, a DEL request for an item and a POST request to add an item to the database. We have 3 tables in the database: Locations, Images, and Items. Locations and Items have a One-to-Many relationship because many items can be found/lost at one location.
